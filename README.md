# RPG Maker: Kids Curriculum

Curriculum to teach kids programming using RPG Maker (VX Ace). This is really a summary of topics/skills that need to be taught in a workshop-type manner.

Pre-requisite: kids need to know how to read (age 5+). For searching Google/DuckDuckGo for stuff (8+), you can substitute in a parent who will perform those tasks with them.

# Basic Course (5yo+)

The basic course introduces your five-plus year old to the essential skills required to create a small game:

- Creating, customizing, and linking together a variety of maps
- Generating characters, picking monsters to battle
- Individualizing their game (title screen, colours, etc.)
- Creating and finding sounds-effects and background audio
- Battles, both random and game-specific (eg. bosses)
- Making small changes, testing changes, and saving changes

By the end of the course, students will have created their own game using the skills learned (above).

# Advanced Course (8yo+)

This course builds on the basic course and teaches advanced topics useful to create larger, more detailed, and more complex/elaborate games:

- Finding and integrating custom scripts
- Character skills, equipment, and progression
- Shops and inns
- Effects like grey-scale, rain, etc.
- Custom battle engines
- Keeping character names/faces consistent in dialogs

We will also cover one advanced topic (student's choice), and a set of custom scripts and miscellania (eg. players choose their characters names).
